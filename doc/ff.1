.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBff\fP(1) is a tool for searching the filesystem for entries that all share a set
of common features. It was inspired by \fBfd\fP(1) but is more powerful and
versatile without being too complex. \fBff\fP(1) aims to be a more user-friendly
alternative to \fBfind\fP(1).
.PP
\fBff\fP(1)'s primary goal is to be an interactive tool that is intuitive,
effective and easy to use. It is optimized for narrowing down a list of
entries step by step. It lets you match many file attributes in many
different ways and is extensible by plugins.
.PP
\fBff\fP(1) takes a set of expressions and directories as arguments and uses them
for searching. If no arguments are specified, \fBff\fP(1) lists all files and
directories below the directory you are currently in.
.PP
Whether an argument is an expression or a directory is detected
automatically. Directories may be at the start or the end of the list of
arguments. They are identified as directories when they contain at least one
\(cq/' and point to an existing name in the filesystem. However, directories can
be explicitly specified using the \fB-D\fP/\fB--directories\fP option, in which case
auto-detection will not be used. If no directory argument is found the
current directory is used as the starting point.
.PP
\fBff\fP(1) uses parallel processes to speed up searching by default. The number of
processes depends on the number of CPU cores and can be controlled with
\fB-j\fP/\fB--jobs\fP.

.SH TESTS
All command line arguments that do not point to a directory will be used as
test expressions. Each filesystem entry is matched against the list of
these tests going from left to right. We start with a set of all entries, and
the tests are used to narrow this set down, or remove particular entries from
the set.
.PP
A test basically has the form:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    [<[plugin.]attribute><operator>]<value>

.fam T
.fi
An test matches a certain <value> or pattern against a certain <attribute> of
a filesystem entry. The type of test performed is denoted by the <operator>.
.PP
The simplest form of a test is to just specify <value>. It is a shorthand for
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    file.name~<value>

.fam T
.fi
which means that each entry's basename is matched against the regular
expression <value>. (This default behavior can be changed with the
\fB-r\fP/\fB--regex\fP, \fB-F\fP/\fB--fixed-strings\fP, \fB-g\fP/\fB--glob\fP and \fB-p\fP/\fB--full-path\fP options.)
.PP
It is good practice to use full attribute names and to quote either the value
or the whole expression to prevent the shell from interfering with characters
like '*', '(', ')', '<', '>', etc.
.PP
Tests can be grouped with 'AND' and 'OR' operators and parenthesis, whereas
the 'AND' can be omitted, because it is redundant. Please note that
parenthesis must be escaped or quoted properly to prevent the shell from
interpreting them. Alternatively, you can use '{{' and '}}' instead.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
\fBff\fP(1) lets you search in a wide variety of file attributes. This list of
attributes is provided by plugins. Essential plugins are built in, and you
can also add your own plugins written in \fBpython\fP(1).
.PP
You can list all available attributes this way: `\fBff\fP \fB--list-attributes\fP`.
.PP
The full name of an attribute consists of the <plugin> name, a dot, and the
<attribute> name. The plugin part of the attribute is optional unless the
same attribute name is provided by multiple plugins. It will produce an error
if an attribute name in an expression is ambiguous. An exception is the
\(cqfile' plugin whose attribute names are global, always take precedence and
will never produce an error. For all other attributes it is recommended to
always write the full attribute name including the <plugin> portion, e.g. to
avoid possible runtime errors in shell scripts.
.PP
The builtin attributes are as follows:
.TP
.B
[file.]path :: string
The full pathname of the file. It will be relative to the current working directory depending on the <directory> arguments that were given on the command line. This can be changed with the \fB-a\fP/\fB--absolute\fP path option.

.PP

.SH TYPES
Each attribute has been assigned a certain type that describes how its value
is supposed to be interpreted and which operators it supports. Beside the
usual 'string', 'number' and 'boolean' types there are types for file sizes,
file permissions, timestamps, durations etc.
.PP
Durations consist of one or more partial time designations that are summed up, e.g.:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    1h30m25s

.fam T
.fi
The valid units are: 's' for seconds, 'm' for minutes, 'h' for hours, 'd' for
days, 'w' for weeks (7 days), 'M' for months (30 days) and 'y' for years (365
days). If no unit is given 'm' for minutes is assumed.
.PP
There are a number of predefined date and time parsing patterns for
attributes providing a 'time' type.
.TP
.B
- YY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS
.TP
.B
- YY-mm-dd HH:MM
.TP
.B
- YYmmddHHMM
.TP
.B
- YY-mm-dd
.TP
.B
- YYmmdd
.TP
.B
- HH:MM:SS
.TP
.B
- HH:MM
.TP
.B
- HHMM
.SH OPERATORS
The third component in a test beside the <attribute> and the <value> is the
<operator>.
.PP
There are operators for numbers:
.TP
.B
=
attribute is equal to <value>
.TP
.B
+= >=
attribute is greater than or equal to <value>
.TP
.B
-= <=
attribute is less than or equal to <value>
.TP
.B
+ >
attribute is greater than <value>
.TP
.B
- <
attribute is less than <value>
.PP
Please note that the > and < characters must be properly quoted to avoid
being interpreted as redirections by the shell, which is why the + and -
forms are preferred.
.PP
Operators for strings:
.TP
.B
=
attribute is equal to <value>
.TP
.B
:
contains substring <value>
.TP
.B
~
matches regular expression <value>
.TP
.B
%
matches glob pattern <value>
.PP
Operators for lists of strings:
.TP
.B
=
one string in the list is equal to <value>
.TP
.B
:
one string contains substring <value>
.TP
.B
~
one string matches regular expression <value>
.TP
.B
%
one string matches glob pattern <value>
.PP
Operators for booleans:
.TP
.B
=
attribute is equal to <value>, which may be one of (true, t, 1, yes,
y, on) or (false, f, 0, no, n, off). The case is ignored.
.PP
Operators for mode:
.TP
.B
=
all bits from the attribute are exactly equal to <value>
.TP
.B
:
all bits that are set in <value> are also set in the attribute
.TP
.B
~
any of the bits that are set in <value> are set in the attribute
.SH FILE REFERENCES
It is possible to pass a path of a file as reference instead of a value. To
use a reference you pass a '{}' followed by the path name as the value. For
example, to find all files newer than foo/bar/example.txt you do:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    ff mtime+{}foo/bar/example.txt

.fam T
.fi
The default behavior is to use the same attribute of the referenced file as
the one it is supposed to be compared to, but it is also possible to use a
different one:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    ff mtime+{atime}foo/bar/example.txt

.fam T
.fi
.SH OUTPUT
The contents of what is printed to standard output can be controlled using
the \fB-o\fP/\fB--output\fP and the \fB--sep\fP options. \fB-o\fP/\fB--output\fP is a comma-separated list
of attribute names, that will be printed using the separator string from the
\fB--sep\fP option. \fB-o\fP/\fB--output\fP defaults to 'path'.
.PP
The \fB-v\fP/\fB--verbose\fP option produces output in the style of 'ls \fB-lh\fP'.
.PP
The \fB--json\fP and \fB--jsonl\fP options print each record as a JSON object to standard
output. The attributes of the JSON object are the same as in \fB-o\fP/\fB--output\fP. The
difference between both options is that \fB--json\fP produces one big JSON list
object containing all the records, whereas the \fB--jsonl\fP prints one JSON object
per record per line.
.PP
By default, pathnames are printed in color according to \fBdircolors\fP(1) rules,
unless NO_COLOR is set, \fB--color\fP=never, or \fBff\fP(1)'s output is not connected to
a terminal. Color output can be forced with \fB--color\fP=always.
.SH EXECUTION
The \fB-x\fP/\fB--exec\fP and \fB-X\fP/\fB--exec-batch\fP options allow to execute commands with
search results as arguments. \fB-x\fP/\fB--exec\fP starts one subprocess for every search
result, whereas \fB-X\fP/\fB--exec-batch\fP starts only one subprocess that gets all
search results at once.
The exit status of \fBff\fP(1) will be set accordingly if one of the commands
terminates with an error, see EXIT CODES below:
.PP
The following placeholders are substituted in the command:
.TP
.B
{}
full path, alias for {path}
.TP
.B
{/}
basename, alias for {name}
.TP
.B
{//}
parent directory, alias for {dir}
.TP
.B
{.}
path without file extension, alias for {pathx}
.TP
.B
{/.}
basename without file extension, alias for {namex}
.TP
.B
{..}
file extension, alias for {ext}
.TP
.B
{attribute}
replaced with the value of attribute
.SH PLUGINS

It is possible to write your own plugins and extend \fBff\fP(1)'s functionality. A
plugin is an ordinary python module. There are many examples included in the
source distribution and a plugin_template.py. User plugins are imported from
~/.\fBff\fP.
.SH EXCLUSION
The \fB-e\fP/\fB--exclude\fP option allows to exclude entries that match the
<expression>. Excluding takes place before all other tests are evaluated.
If a directory matches it will not be descended into, so entries below it
will not be produced.
.PP
Please note: Unless \fB-H\fP/\fB--hidden\fP is given, all hidden files will be excluded
using this method (the same as '\fB--exclude\fP hide=yes'). So it is not possible
to find hidden entries with
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    ff hidden=yes

.fam T
.fi
unless \fB-H\fP/\fB--hidden\fP is specified. The same applies to \fB-I\fP/\fB--ignored\fP.
.SH IGNORE FILES
By default, \fBff\fP(1) reads .gitignore, .ignore, .fdignore, and .ffignore files
and excludes all entries that match the set of patterns in one of these
files. The ignore syntax is described in \fBgitignore\fP(5).
.SH SORTING
Sorting is controlled with \fB-S\fP/\fB--sort\fP option. It is off by default, this way
entries are processed and printed as they are found. This makes better use
of \fBff\fP(1)'s parallel processing capabilities and is much faster.
.PP
\fB-S\fP/\fB--sort\fP takes an optional <attribute-list> argument. Without it, sorting is
done alphabetically on the entry's path. <attribute-list> is a
comma-separated list of attribute names that will be used as sort criteria.
The order can be reversed with \fB-R\fP/\fB--reverse\fP.
.SH COUNTING
If the \fB--count\fP option is specified, instead of printing the search result,
count the entries and the attributes from <attribute-list> and print these
counts to standard output. If \fB--count\fP is given without a list of attributes
the total file size and statistics about the different file types is
displayed. If <attribute-list> is present a total or a count of these
attributes is done. There is always a "_total" field that contains the number
of all entries that matched.
.PP
There are two ways of counting attributes that depend on their type. Types
like file size or duration that vary widely are summed up to a total and for
all other types each individual value is counted. This way you can get an
overview on the variety of values of an attribute. For some attributes
\fB--count\fP makes not much sense, e.g. path or time. It is best suited for
attributes like type, perm, hidden, depth, uid, gid, etc.
.PP
The way a type is counted can be checked with \fB--list-types\fP.
