# I hope this is only a temporary work-around: We rely heavily on assert
# statements and __debug__ code blocks, which will be removed when using -O.
# The idea was that in a production environment ff would be started via shebang
# with the -O option, whereas debug mode could be entered by simply calling
# `python -m libff`.
# Unfortunately, setuptools seems to mess up the shebang line and replaces it
# with the path to the python interpreter without with no regard for further
# options.
